                <p>
                    I'm a Game Design and Development major at Rochester Institute of Technology.
                    I love video games and everything that contributed to making a game, be it art, soundtrack, storytelling,...
                    Myself, I can contribute to designing and crafting gameplay mechanics and systems that can elevate the game itself,
                    as well as other elements of the game.
                    Whenever I'm not programming, debugging codes and finding even more bugs to squash, you would find me enjoying a 
                    good book or researching whatever I'm interested in at the time.

                    <p class="first-para">
                        Spear Chaser is an arcadey browser game, made using JavaScript and PixiJS, that combines pinball with bullet hell.
                        In this game, the player must survive as long as possible by launching themselves at walls and bouncing
                        off of them to avoid bullets, defeat enemies and gain points. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This game is a solo project, thus, both the code and art assets are made by myself. Sound effects can be
                        found here: <a href = "http://soundbible.com/">http://soundbible.com/</a>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Thanks to this project, I was able to  broaden my knowledge on PixiJS and JavaScript, throughout the project,
                        as well as by overcoming some challenges. One of such is the performance optimization of the game. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At the later
                        stages of the project, I realized that the game was slower and the framerate was also much lower at later rounds
                        of the game. This was due to the large number of enemies on the screen, as well as mouse inputs getting registered
                        multiple times in one click. Cycling through the enemies, updating them and processing mouse inputs obviously 
                        put a dent on the game performance. With the former being inevitable due to the nature of the game, I had to switch 
                        the event listeners to register when the mouse is clicked, not the whole duration of the click.
                    </p>

                        <span>The Golden Ankh</span>
                    </h3>

                    <p class="first-para">
                        The Golden Ankh is an adventure/puzzle-solving game project made using C# and the MonoGame framework by a group of 
                        three. In this game, the player possess a magical boomerang that can not only be thrown and return to you, but you 
                        can also switch
                        your position with it. With this magical artifact, the player will journey into a mythical pyramid filled with traps
                        and mummies in order to find the Golden Ankh.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For this project, I am responsible for making most of the sprites, including the main character, the mummies,
                        the platform tiles and the starting screen animations. I also worked on implementing the basic physics 
                        and collison systems that the game uses.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is one of my earliest project, so I was able to learnt a lot on working in a team, how to use the 
                        MonoGame framework, and some coding principles that I still uses. This is thanks to the challenges that 
                        I encountered throughout the project, one of which was a big problem for the game when I was working on 
                        collision. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I tried to make a type of tile that can be used for all situations instead of utilizing classes. 
                        This cause many errors like the player character phasing through walls and floors, or them getting
                        teleported to the top of a platform wherever they collide with them.

                        GIF Finder is a website is made using JavaScript, GIPHY API and Shareholic API. The website can be used to browser
                        GIFs using GIPHY API, save them to your favorite "Local Storage" and view them later, copy the link to your 
                        clipboard, sharing them on Twitter and Facebook using Shareholic API.

                        Most of the codes were written by myself based on an earlier project, so was some of the SVG codes.

                    <p>
                        Since this project is mainly JavaScript, I learnt a lot about it, mainly on getting inputs, "for of" and 
                        "for in" loops and local storage.

                    <p>
                        The biggest challenge I encountered was the "Load more" function. For 
                        this function, I had to create a new variable to keep track of the current number of results, and add more to
                        it whenever the button is clicked. After that, the website send a request for more GIFs from GIPHY
                        with that number as the offset
                        , remove the load more button and add the new results to the old result array.
