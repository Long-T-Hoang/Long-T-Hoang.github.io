            <p>
                NieR Visualizer is an audio visualizer and game hybrid project for a web development class. The reason why I chose to theme it
                after the NieR franchise is because it's one of my favorite series, the music are amazing and also and integral part of the series 
                that was utilized extremely well with the gameplay and story. Other than the theme and music, I also based the gameplay on parts of 
                NieR Automata gameplay, but made some changes so that it fits better with the visualizer.
            </p>

            <p>
                The main gameplay is the player trying to dodge the projectiles while avoiding the barrier, which will stun the player briefly and push them towards the center.
                The gameplay is mostly a side activity that the user can entertain themselves with while listening to the music and customize it however they want.
            </p>

            <p>
                I learnt a lot about the WebAudio API from this project, as well as being able to gain more experience using algorithms, both to
                make the audio visualizer customizable, make the projectiles spawn match the beat of the music be fair for the player, and adding a static
                effect to the visualizer, which is drawn using Canvas API. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I also applied many UI design choices so that the customization don't make the game unplayable. Canvas effects such as gradient and "Emil mode" 
                have different color for their background so that the projectiles can still be seen easily, while still keeping the theme and the palette of
                the NieR games.
            </p>

            <p>
                While I'm very proud of this project for how polished it is, there are still more features that I would like to add if I didn't have a deadline
                as this is a school project. One of such is different theme for some of the songs for their significance in the NieR stories, I believe this 
                would help convey the feelings behind these songs better. I would also like to add more gameplay features like actual dodging mechanic, instead of just 
                moving around, as well as as the ability to shoot to the player, like in NieR Automata hacking minigame. In my opinion, this would make the gameplay more active,
                instead of just passively moving between the projectiles.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally the project can make use of more balance in terms of gameplay. Even though I tried my best to make it fair but challenging for the player,
                the projectiles spawn far too much, while some of them never even make it to the player before getting destroyed as they have an internal timer. 
                This cause the player score to increase in an obtuse way while they're seemingly getting pummelled by projectiles. 
            </p>
