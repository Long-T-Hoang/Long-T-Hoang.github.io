                Spear Chaser is an arcadey browser game, made using JavaScript and PixiJS, that combines pinball with bullet hell.
                In this game, the player must survive as long as possible by launching themselves at walls and bouncing
                off of them to avoid bullets, defeat enemies and gain points. 
            </p>

            <p>
                This game is a solo project, thus, both the code and art assets are made by myself. Sound effects can be
                found here: <a href = "http://soundbible.com/">http://soundbible.com/</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                Thanks to this project, I was able to  broaden my knowledge on PixiJS and JavaScript, throughout the project,
                as well as by overcoming some challenges. One of such is the performance optimization of the game. 
            </p>

            <p>
                At the later
                stages of the project, I realized that the game was slower and the framerate was also much lower at later rounds
                of the game. This was due to the large number of enemies on the screen, as well as mouse inputs getting registered
                multiple times in one click. Cycling through the enemies, updating them and processing mouse inputs obviously 
                put a dent on the game performance. With the former being inevitable due to the nature of the game, I had to switch 
                the event listeners to register when the mouse is clicked, not the whole duration of the click.
            </p>
