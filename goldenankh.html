                The Golden Ankh is an adventure/puzzle-solving game project made using C# and the MonoGame framework by a group of 
                three. In this game, the player possess a magical boomerang that can not only be thrown and return to you, but you 
                can also switch
                your position with it. With this magical artifact, the player will journey into a mythical pyramid filled with traps
                and mummies in order to find the Golden Ankh.
            </p>

            <p>
                For this project, I am responsible for making most of the sprites, including the main character, the mummies,
                the platform tiles and the starting screen animations. I also worked on implementing the basic physics 
                and collison systems that the game uses.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is one of my earliest project, so I was able to learnt a lot on working in a team, how to use the 
                MonoGame framework, and some coding principles that I still uses. This is thanks to the challenges that 
                I encountered throughout the project, one of which was a big problem for the game when I was working on 
                collision. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I tried to make a type of tile that can be used for all situations instead of utilizing classes. 
                This cause many errors like the player character phasing through walls and floors, or them getting
                teleported to the top of a platform wherever they collide with them. 
            </p>
